LearnQuest Description:
`Students in general often struggle with motivation, engagement,
and conceptual understanding when learning new subjects.
Traditional teaching methods present learning material in static
ways which can lead to a lack of focus and difficulty with
connecting key concepts. The concept behind LearnQuest
attempts to tackle this problem by fostering user interest and
consistent practice. This concept revolves around combining
interactive activities, community driven courses, and reward
systems.`
